#Ability System#

This is a flexible solution for an ability system.

The goal of this library is to provide a framework for implementing abilities that can essentially do "anything".

Examples of desired supported ability behaviour are as follows:
- On-cast effects to the caster
- Traveling vehicles and on-hit effects to the receiver
- Resource cost and manipulation
- Cooldown cost and manipulation
- Support for on press, on hold and on release

This list is subject to change.
